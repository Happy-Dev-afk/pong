My first game from the 20 Game Challenge.

A simple Pong clone made in Unity to understand the basics of movement, collision, and scoring.

Learned how to set up a basic game loop, control paddles with input, and make the ball bounce using Rigidbody2D.

Not perfect â€” but it's finished, and that's what matters.
